# TIL

So to tell you all what this repo is all about it is to actually leave some things that I have studied
throughout my studying journey to become a good programmer. I will always love to program cause first,
it's awesome. With a descent laptop you can make anything. If you know how to code both front and back
you can always make something that you always dreamt of. So because of that i will always learn how to code and modify my laptop and environment to code more efficiently.

There are many ways to contribute to this TIL repo, and one thing is you can make your own file and start uploading your things. I won't say anything about it. Second please when you see me buy a beer! LMAO

In case some of you guys out there wondering how to use MD documents and the grammar of it here are some tips.

# head1
## head2
### head3
#### head4
##### head5
###### head6

when you want to emphasize something just put ** and you will be fine. You must wrap it up with **. So the use will be like
```md
so I want to **tell** you something. Or two underbars like __I want this sentense to be bold.__ 
```
there are many things that you can do like you can
```md
We can also *make the be italic* like this. Underbar would do the samething to this. Like _my face is melting_ see?
```
Let's say we want to write something and but a crossing line in the middle then it's just two ~ these wrapping the text. Also if you want to underline the text just use the tag ```<u> </u>``` and it should work just find <u>see</u>?

### list
okay so now we are moving on to lists. These are important because you will be making a whole bunch of lists when you write down something. 

1. So
2. this
3. is 
4. how 
5. you 
   1. and
   2. oh look  
      1. look how it goes
           - and you can switch
           - like this!
           - look how awesome this is!
             - wow see?

### links
If you want to add any links or images. Well this is what you want to use. 

[Google](http://google.com)
[Github](http://github.io)

so the formatting goes
```md
[Google](http://google.com)
[Github](http://github.io)
```

### images
With images you would want to include must be with the same directory and must be added when something is uploaded. So the syntax would look like..
```md
![alt-text](the-link "summary of the image") 
```

So now we have gone through most of the basic syntax of markdown. Now because you can be writing codes a lot whenever you need to write a code inside a line you can always `hello` and say it like this.
```md
so the `syntax` goes like this.
```

Did you know you can also make tables
| value | meaning | default |
| --- |:---:|---:|
|`static`| nothing/not possible | `static`

like this! so cool right? so the whole syntax would go
```md
| value | meaning | default |
| --- |:---:|---:|
|`static`| nothing/not possible | `static`
```

oh and if you need to change lines just use `<br>` and you will be fine.

I think this is pretty much everything that's important and the real basics that you should know when writing an md file. Have fun writing and try to provide quality content.
